# Loan Default Risk Analysis using Machine Learning

A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts loan default risk using Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods. This project demonstrates end-to-end data science workflow from data exploration to model deployment.

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes loan application data to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. Using various machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, we build predictive models to identify high-risk loan applicants, helping financial institutions make better lending decisions.

### Key Features
- **Data Exploration & Visualization**: Comprehensive EDA to understand data patterns
- **Multiple ML Models**: Comparison of Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model performance
- **Feature Importance**: Identification of key risk factors
- **Business Insights**: Actionable recommendations for risk management

```

## üìà Dataset Description

The dataset contains 5,000 loan applications with the following features:

### Features
- **Demographic**: Age, Marital Status, Education
- **Financial**: Income, Credit Score, Debt-to-Income Ratio
- **Loan Details**: Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Loan Term, Loan Purpose
- **Employment**: Employment Type, Months Employed
- **Other**: Number of Credit Lines, Has Mortgage, Has Dependents, Has Co-signer

### Target Variable
- `Default`: Binary indicator (1 = Default, 0 = No Default)

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (where necessary)
- Train-test split (80-20)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Target variable distribution analysis
- Feature distributions and correlations
- Categorical feature analysis
- Risk factor identification

### 3. Model Development
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC curves
- Confusion matrices
- Feature importance analysis

## üìä Results

### Model Performance Comparison
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Decision Tree | 0.85 | 0.78 | 0.72 | 0.75 | 0.88 |
| Random Forest | 0.89 | 0.82 | 0.80 | 0.81 | 0.93 |

| Gradient Boosting | 0.88 | 0.81 | 0.78 | 0.79 | 0.92 |

### Key Findings
- **Random Forest** achieved the best overall performance
- **Credit Score** and **DTI Ratio** are the most important features
- **Unemployed applicants** have significantly higher default rates
- **Education loans** show lower default rates compared to other purposes

## üí° Business Insights

### High-Risk Segments Identified
1. Applicants with **Credit Score < 600**
2. **Unemployed** individuals
3. **High DTI Ratio** (>0.6) applicants
4. **Certain education levels** (High School only)

### Recommendations
1. Implement automated risk scoring for loan applications
2. Focus manual review on high-risk segments
3. Consider additional verification for unemployed applicants
4. Adjust interest rates based on predicted risk levels
